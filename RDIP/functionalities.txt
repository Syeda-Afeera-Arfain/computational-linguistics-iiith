Functionalities:
1)When we select a language ,accordingly a sentence will be appear 'Form a sentence from the given words' with jumbled words which are actually buttons 
When we click a word(button) ,another sentence will be appear 'Formed Sentence'which contains the selected word along with a button (reform the sentence).

2)'Reform the sentence' is like a reset button which means it will return all the words which we have chosen, again to the jumbled words.

3)When we make a proper sentence with all the words then a button will we appear 'Check the correctness of this sentence'.
Here the sentence we make will be checked by all the possible correct sentences .If the sentence is simantically and syntactically correct then it will display "Rigth answer!!'

4)If the sentence made is incorrect then it will display "Wrong answer!!!"
Along with that a button will appear 'Get correct answer' which when click will display the correct sentences and the 'Get correct sentence'will become 'Hide the sentence'
which will hide the correct sentences,and after clicking to 'hide the  correct sentence'  the button will become 'Get correct sentence' and so on.

I think another function ('Return' button)should be include which will return the last selected word back to the jumbled words.
